## Didit360 App - Cloud Infrastructure Guide
This document provides a comprehensive guide for setting up, running, and deploying the Didit360 App while adhering to industry best practices.
The proposed guide is a solid foundation for the Didit360 App, but given the diversity of products under Didit360(Music, Podcasts, Audiobooks, MusicNFT, SireAI), it can be refined further to account for each product's unique requirements. Here's how it can be optimized for best practices based on the different products:

## Tech Stack Adjustments
Since Didit360 has diverse offerings, the stack should balance scalability, performance, and flexibility:
- Backend: Stick with Node.js for fast API responses and its ecosystem's flexibility.
- For AI integrations (SireAI), consider a Python microservice (e.g., Flask/FastAPI) since Python excels in AI/ML processing.
- Frontend: Use React Native for cross-platform mobile development to provide a seamless user experience across iOS and Android.
- Database: A hybrid approach is best:
1. Relational DB (PostgreSQL): For structured data like user profiles, subscriptions, and playlists.
2. NoSQL DB (MongoDB): For unstructured data like metadata for music, podcasts, and audiobooks.
3. Redis: Critical for caching real-time data (e.g., streaming buffers and user activity).
## Running the App for Multiple Products
For modularity, divide the application into microservices based on product categories:
- Music, Podcasts, and Audiobooks: Shared APIs for playback, metadata, and user interactions.
- MusicNFT: Dedicated blockchain microservice for minting and managing NFTs.
- SireAI: Isolated microservice for AI/ML functionalities.
## Commands for individual microservices:
```s
bash 

cd services/music && npm install && npm start
cd services/nft && npm install && npm start
```

## Dependencies Specific to Products
### Music/Podcasts/Audiobooks:
- Transcoding: FFmpeg for audio/video encoding.
- Cloud Storage: S3/Blob for media storage.
### MusicNFT:
- Blockchain: Infura or Alchemy for Ethereum network connections.
- Smart Contracts: Solidity contracts for minting NFTs.
### SireAI:
- Python libraries like TensorFlow/PyTorch for ML, spaCy for NLP, and FastAPI for serving the AI models.

Environment Variables Environment variables should include service-specific parameters:

### Music/Podcasts/Audiobooks:
```s 
S3_BUCKET_NAME=didit360-media
TRANSCODE_WORKER_COUNT=5
```

### MusicNFT:
```s
BLOCKCHAIN_PROVIDER=https://eth-mainnet.infura.io/v3/<api-key>
NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<contract-address>
```

## SireAI:
```s
AI_MODEL_PATH=/models/sireai
AI_TIMEOUT=30s
```

## Deployment Adjustments for Specific Use Cases
- Shared Storage: Use AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage for centralized media storage, accessible across all microservices.
- Real-Time Streaming: Implement Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) like Cloudflare for low-latency delivery of audio and video.
- AI Workloads: Deploy SireAI on GPU-enabled instances (e.g., AWS EC2 G4dn).
- NFT Service: Host blockchain nodes using a service like Infura to avoid direct node hosting overhead.

## Scaling Considerations
Music and video streaming require significant resources. Use:
- Horizontal Scaling: Auto-scale music/podcast playback microservices with Kubernetes.
- Serverless Functions: For short-lived tasks like transcoding or NFT minting (e.g., AWS Lambda).
- Load Balancing: Set up API Gateways for each product to ensure a smooth user experience.


## Monitoring and Logging
- Integrate Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring system performance.
- Use ELK Stack or AWS CloudWatch for analyzing logs across all microservices.
## Security Best Practices
- MusicNFT: Ensure smart contracts are audited before deployment to avoid vulnerabilities.
- User Data: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (TLS for APIs, AES-256 for storage).
- API Gateway: Add rate limiting and IP whitelisting for sensitive operations (e.g., NFT minting).

## Why This is Best for Didit360:
- Scalability: Supports the high demand of streaming media and real-time user interactions.
- Flexibility: Microservices allow independent scaling and updates for each product.
- Performance: CDN and caching ensure fast delivery of media and responses.
- Security: Environment variables, encrypted connections, and smart contract audits safeguard user data and transactions.
- Future-Readiness: Easily extensible for new features or products within the Didit360 ecosystem.
